Use Git.
Automate the build.
Turn on all error messages.
Treat warnings as errors both on debug and release.
CI build should work in Release mode.
Automate deployment to some webserver. That would be your production environment.
production/master (and not develop) branch should trigger CI.
Enable static code analysers (linters). They will force style rules.
